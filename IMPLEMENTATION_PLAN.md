## Migration Strategy

### Parallel Operation Approach
1. **API Gateway**: Route traffic between old and new systems
2. **Database Synchronization**: Real-time data sync during transition
3. **Gradual Migration**: Module-by-module feature switching
4. **Rollback Plan**: Immediate fallback to Laravel system if needed

### Data Migration
1. **Schema Mapping**: Laravel → Symfony entity mapping
2. **Data Export**: Comprehensive data extraction from Laravel
3. **Data Import**: Batch processing into Symfony system
4. **Validation**: Data integrity verification

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Mitigation - Comprehensive backup and sync strategies
2. **Downtime**: Mitigation - Parallel operation and gradual migration
3. **Feature Gaps**: Mitigation - Detailed feature audit and testing
4. **Team Learning Curve**: Mitigation - Training and documentation

### Medium Risks
1. **Integration Issues**: Comprehensive API testing
2. **Performance Degradation**: Load testing and optimization
3. **Third-party Dependencies**: Vendor evaluation and alternatives

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms average
- **Database Query Performance**: < 100ms average
- **Test Coverage**: > 90%
- **Code Quality Score**: > 8.5/10

### Business Metrics
- **Feature Parity**: 100% of current features
- **User Adoption**: Smooth transition with < 5% user issues
- **System Availability**: > 99.9% uptime
